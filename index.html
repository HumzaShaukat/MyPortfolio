            <img class="headshot " src="Assets/headshot.jpg" alt="Headshot of Humza Shaukat">
            <p>My name is Humza Shaukat.  I currently live in Franklin Park, New Jersey and am currently working on completing the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp focused on web development.  I graduated from the University of Michigan with a Bachelor of Science in Neuroscience in 2018 while completing coursework learning C++ and R.  After graduating, I taught myself Python and MATLAB to create scripts to analyze electrophysiology and immunohistochemistry data.  I am currently looking for jobs in full-stack, frontend, and bioinformatics development positions.</p>
